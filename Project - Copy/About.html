				<div id="about1">We are a church family based on a simple truth – that the key to happiness in life is to give glory to the Lord and obedience to the Word of God.<br><br>
					We believe that the Bible is God’s Holy Word and is Profitable (2 Timothy 3:16). In other words, The Bible has the answers to our questions, even in the 21st century. 
					Learning the scriptures give us the guidance we need for today! (2 Timothy 2:15)<br><br>
					We believe that God established Preaching as a means to stir the hearts of men and women. The Holy Spirit of God speaks through the Preaching of the Bible. 
					Many churches today have left old-fashioned preaching for a softer and more comfortable teaching style. While teaching has its place, 
					we make no apology for being one of the few in the Valley that still “Preach the Word!” (2Timothy 4:2 ) That is why our church puts emphasis on Bible-inspired preaching, 
					Spirit-filled music, and Christ-centered fellowship.<br><br>
					We hope you'll come and worship with us, and that the Lord will touched your heart in a special way. We want to be a blessing to you and your family.
